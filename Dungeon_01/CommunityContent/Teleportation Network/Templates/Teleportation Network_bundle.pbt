    Description: "A basic setup with teleportation pads. A central hub contains teleporters to each location, and each of those has a teleporter back to the main hub.\r\n\r\nTeleportation is very simple in Core, it\'s just assigning a new position to a player.\r\n\r\nIn this component a trigger is given a destination object. When a player overlaps the trigger they are moved to the destination. By combining several teleportation components together we can form a network of locations within a game that connect to each other.\r\n\t\r\nThis has many uses. In terms of gameplay it can be used for puzzles or for fast-travel. For productivity during creation time you can conveniently hop around the map in a single preview session to test some game systems or level design. Finally, another use case is during recording of a trailer for your game you can have all players go together from location to location and record the different shots.\r\n\r\n1.2\r\n- Fixed a bug where the ROOT variable was lower-case in one instance."
