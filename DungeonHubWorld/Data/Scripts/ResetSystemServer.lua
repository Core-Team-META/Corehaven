--[[
This system has a general issue where the reset causes it to remove all of the NPCs. Because of other complications this
kills all of the current npcs, which triggers a bunch of things, like opening doors and finished objectives. Because of
performance, that is done over a few seconds. Therefore each system may have to wait 5-10 seconds before reseting so
the work doesn't get undone.
